# Notes:
# Makes some assumptions in getting the commits: uses the published at date of the last release
# as the "since" argument to get commits since then. In theory this may exclude merge commits that happened
# in between the creation and the publish, although this shouldn't be happening. Not using the created at date
# because was including commits from last release.
# This is also using the "list commits" rather than "compare" functionality, as it is lighter weight and also
# simpler to paginate. This may mean that our "number of commits since last release" may not be identical in count,
# but the logic by checking on dates when we only care about merge commits should be sound.
# See discussion here for jumping off point:
